# ScoreKeeper

The scoring system is based on a form of golf called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stableford">Stableford</a> system.

<b>Gameplay:</b>

Each team has 9 strokes (hits), and the Red team strokes first.<br/>
Eagle worth 4 points, Birdie 3 points, Par 2 points , Bogey 1 point, Double bogey 0 point.<br/>
After 9 strokes the app announces the winner, or the draw. Then you can play again!<br/>

<b>Features:</b>

Each turn only one side of the buttons are enabled.<br/>
When the buttons are disabled, the background color of the button is transparent.<br/>
Switching to landscape mode, scores and the current team’s buttons are remaining the same state.<br/>
When the game ends both team’s buttons are disabled. Except the play again.<br/>

Have fun!

Further improvements:<br/>
